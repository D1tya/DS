# Assuming you've downloaded the dataset as 'titanic.csv'

# Variable descriptions
# Survived: Whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
# Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
# Name: Passenger's name
# Sex: Passenger's sex
# Age: Passenger's age
# SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
# Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
# Ticket: Ticket number
# Fare: Passenger fare
# Cabin: Cabin number
# Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

# Check dimensions of the DataFrame
print(df.shape)
# Check data types
print(df.dtypes)

# Convert data types if needed
# For example, if 'Age' should be integer:
df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype(int)
# Similarly, you can convert other variables to appropriate data types
# Convert categorical variables to quantitative variables using one-hot encoding
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Sex', 'Embarked'])
# This will create binary columns for 'Sex' and 'Embarked' categories
